# BerryLoader

BerryLoader is a modding framework for [Sokpop's](https://sokpop.co/) hit card-based village builder: [Stacklands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands)

## Features

- Simple ways to create custom cards, packs, menus, and more
- Simple APIs for modifying cards and boards
- Discord integration
- Tools for dumping game data

## Installation (manual)

You need the [pre-configured BepInEx pack](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands) for this mod. If you installed BepInEx from a different place, you will need to edit the config files.

Extract the contents of this folder to `Stacklands/BepInEx/plugins/BerryLoader`. The final folder layout should look like this:
```
plugins/
  BerryLoader/
    BerryLoader.dll
    discord_game_sdk.dll
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```
